At this point, we have written code to generate a random hand and display that hand to the user. We can also ask the user for a word (Python's raw_input) and score the word (using your getWordScore). However, at this point we have not written any code to verify that a word given by a player obeys the rules of the game. A valid word is in the word list; and it is composed entirely of letters from the current hand. Implement the isValidWord function.

def isValidWord(word, hand, wordList):
    """
    Returns True if word is in the wordList and is entirely
    composed of letters in the hand. Otherwise, returns False.

    Does not mutate hand or wordList.
   
    word: string
    hand: dictionary (string -> int)
    wordList: list of lowercase strings
    """
    count=0
    handtemp=hand.copy()
    if word=='':
        return False
    else:
        if word in wordList:
            for char in word:
                if char in handtemp and handtemp.get(char)!=0:
                    count=count+1
                    handtemp[char]=handtemp.get(char)-1
            return count==len(word)
        else:
            return False
