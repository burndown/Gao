REPRESENTING HANDS

A hand is the set of letters held by a player during the game. 
The player is initially dealt a set of random letters. 
For example, the player could start out with the following hand: a, q, l, m, u, i, l. In our program, a hand will be represented as a dictionary: the keys are (lowercase) letters and the values are the number of times the particular letter is repeated in that hand. 
For example, the above hand would be represented as:
def updateHand(hand, word):
    """
    Assumes that 'hand' has all the letters in word.
    In other words, this assumes that however many times
    a letter appears in 'word', 'hand' has at least as
    many of that letter in it. 

    Updates the hand: uses up the letters in the given word
    and returns the new hand, without those letters in it.

    Has no side effects: does not modify hand.

    word: string
    hand: dictionary (string -> int)    
    returns: dictionary (string -> int)
    """
    handupdate=hand.copy()
    for char in word:
	    handupdate[char]=handupdate.get(char)-1
    return handupdate
